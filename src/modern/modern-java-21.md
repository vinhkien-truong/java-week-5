# Modern Java Preview (Sealed Classes & Pattern Matching)

This is a short preview of features commonly mentioned in Java 21 and Java 25 certification prep.

## 1. Sealed Classes

```java
public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Rectangle {}

public final class Circle extends Shape {}
public non-sealed class Rectangle extends Shape {}
```

Sealed classes restrict which classes are allowed to extend or implement a type.

Normally, any class could extend a public class.
With sealed classes, the parent class explicitly defines the allowed subclasses using the permits keyword.

Permitted subclasses must declare one of the following:

final → cannot be extended further

sealed → can restrict its own subclasses

non-sealed → removes the restriction again

This gives developers more control over inheritance hierarchies.

## 2. Pattern Matching for instanceof

```java
//Traditionally, instanceof required two steps:
if (obj instanceof String) {
    String text = (String) obj;
}


if (obj instanceof String text)
{
    System.out.println(text.length());
}
//Modern Java combines type checking and casting into one step.
```

The variable (text) is called a pattern variable and is only available in the branch where the check succeeds.
